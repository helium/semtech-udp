# Semtech UDP

Semtech UDP provides serialization and deserialization of packets complying with the Semtech GWMP over UDP protocol.

The `server` feature provides a Tokio-based runtime which handles the UDP and Semtech GWMP UDP protocol details, such as
ACKs and keeping track of client addresses. It exposes an async API for receiving all messages for the client and an 
asynchronous send function which returns only when the transmit ack (tx_ack) is received.

The `client` feature provides a Tokio-based runtime which handles the UDP and Semtech UDP protocol details, such as ACKs.
